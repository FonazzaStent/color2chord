Color to Chord 1.1.0

The program will convert colors in RGB format to 5 note chords. Run the executable and you will be prompted
for R, G, and B value of your color. Input the values and hit enter to generate the chord. The chord will
be displayed in letter notation format. Hit Enter for a random value. You can set random values for each
R, G and B channel individually and independently from the other two channels, so the color can have one,
two or all three channels set on a random value.
Input more R, G, B values for another chord or "q" to quit the program.
